b) Java 8, Mac OS 10.9.5, Sublime Text, Terminal

c) In a UNIX-like environment, if javac is installed, using a terminal, 
   change the current directory to the directory of this file 
   (and its associated files). Since there is an included Makefile, 
   if Make is installed, simply run 'make', which will run 
   'javac *.java && java StronglyConnectedComponents p3_input.txt'; 
   if Make is not installed, run the latter combination of commands 
   or whatever is appropriate for the user's system configurations.

   Once the program has been successfully compiled and run with the included 
   input file, a different input file may be used by running 
   'java StronglyConnectedComponents FILENAME', where FILENAME is the
   name of the (text) input file with the proper format extension.

d) The data structure implemented is essentially a singly-linked list as each node   
   ('vertex') has the potential to link to a 'parent' node.

   As instructed, the implementation of the algorithms follow, 
   as precisely as possible in Java, the algorithms presented as pseudocode in 
   Corment, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.).
   From a software design perspective, the code is efficient to be sure
   but, in my opinion, at the expense of human readability.
   Moreover, common software design principles are ignored; 
   for example, instance variables (e.g., pi, name, etc.) are 
   accessed/modified directly (and, thus, are public) as opposed to being 
   accessed/modified only through 'getter'/'setter' methods.
