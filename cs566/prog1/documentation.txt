a) Java 8, Mac OS 10.9.5, Sublime Text, Terminal

b) In a UNIX-like environment, if javac is installed, using a terminal, 
change the current directory to the directory of this file 
(and its associated files). Since there is an included Makefile, 
if Make is installed, simply run 'make', which will run 
'javac *.java && java IntegerStore'; if Make is not installed, 
run the latter combination of commands or whatever is appropriate for 
the user's system configurations.

c) The data structure implemented is essentially a triply-linked list as each node 
has the potential to link to a 'parent' and both left and right 'children'.

d) As instructed, the implementation of the algorithms follow, 
  as precisely as possible in Java, the algorithms presented as pseudocode in 
  Corment, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein's Introduction to Algorithms (3rd ed.).
  From a software design perspective, the code is efficient to be sure
  but, in my opinion, at the expense of human readability.
  Moreover, common software design principles are ignored; 
  for example, instance variables (e.g., root, key, etc.) are 
  accessed/modified directly (and, thus, are public) as opposed to being 
  accessed/modified only through 'getter'/'setter' methods.
