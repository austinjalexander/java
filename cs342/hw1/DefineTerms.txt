1. Define the following terms, as used in Java:

A. protected: an access modifier allowing use of a given class' instance variables
   and/or methods by instances of that class and its children/subclasses.

B. static: a declaration modifier that implements variables/methods in a class
   as class variables/methods (i.e., making them belong to the class, not to
   instances of the class).

C. new: an operator that instantiates a class by allocating memory for an object.

D. interface: a reference type containing only constants and method signatures 
              (although static methods can contain implementation), which describes
              how a given class may be used (via the method signatures), thus, 
              hiding that class' implementation details.

E. abstract: a declaration modifier for classes or methods that lack implementation
             details; in the case of abstract classes, they cannot be instantiated,
             but they can have children/subclasses, which is usually how they are
             used.
